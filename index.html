        <p>For some students, Research Project in their final year is something they find very useful, they finally have a chance to try doing something bigger.
             But it is not enough to start building something almost at the end. 
            That’s why this idea appeared. How else we could help those who graduating and want to work in the art industry, be successful and not be worried about another day? 
            An “AFTER-uni-LIFE” website. It is open, for any art student, option to gain experience and make connections, for them to make the first steps. 
             
        </p>
        <p>
            The home page, allows users to see everything that others post, investigate that, sending their applications for projects. 
            The following page is only to see posts from people/companies that are currently followed. 
            On the right bottom appears a calendar with any events that happen soon. 
        </p>
        <p">
            The next pages are a personal/business profile. 
            Personal, it’s for students who are looking for jobs, such as actors, models etc. with space to upload headshots, personal information, life goals, and contact details. Also, a video sample, and links to any work they’ve done already. By applying for a job, can send a link to a personal profile where the ones interested can check what they need to know to hire them. 
            Business profile, which looks very similar to a personal one, with slight differences. It is for companies or/and for students who are creators. Such as filmmakers, photographers etc. It would contain a description of the work they’ve done already, some basic information and pictures or/and videos of their previous projects. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Those are the most important few pages. 
            AFTER-uni-LIFE is not just a website is an opportunity to bring all students together, make them work together, know each other for the future and help each other out. It is necessary for students to have that and be able to gain more experience. By talking with some students, I realised how less they did for the past three years and mostly because they didn’t know how to do more, how to find themselves out there. With a website like that, they could start from Year 1 and not be scared anymore when graduation time comes.

                <p>Both videos show interviews about life after graduation, projects that those young people have done and what they think about the website for students. One interview introduces Nikoleta Stefanova, and the other one Antonios Katoikos, they both talk about projects they have made recently. Nikoleta shares her point of view from the student side and Antonios from the graduate side. Both have different experiences and different points of view, but one thing connects, they both decided to take the risk and do something on their own. One was more successful, the other less but they managed quite well however, they struggled to find resources and support to allow them to achieve their goals. They both agreed that having something like the website proposed, would make it significantly easier for them, and others like them, to find resources, places, people, and companies. Thus, allowing them to achieve their goals and career aspirations after uni life. </p>

            <p >How to walk into a real-life work environment after university?</p>
            <p>When starting university, people don’t think about how hard it will be to find a job after graduation. As students, it is easy to think “Of course, I’m going to find a job, I’m going to be a graduate, how hard can it be?”, real-life unfortunately looks completely opposite to what we all think it is. Many art students want to be succeeded, want to be -actors, -photographers, -designers, -painters, etc. However, without help, it is almost impossible to reach that. This environment is closed to the people from outside, someone is either very unique, visible or has connections when it is the second option most likely to help. There are a few most important steps people should make to make it easier in the art industry, for example, -getting a degree, -making a portfolio, - start networking. Just saying that sounds very easy like everyone could do it and become a successful artist.  Unfortunately, life isn’t as easy as words are. Getting a degree is what all of us do nowadays, is it enough to make it into life confident? No, if we don’t do anything in between. No, if we don’t gain any experience. No, if there is nothing we can show to our next employer.  </p>
            <p>First, everyone who just starts their adventure with art needs to know the most important fact, it is not easy, it is not fast, and it is not for everyone. When starting a career, must be prepared for many weeks, and months of hard work, but sometimes many of those will be just looking for a job, just looking for opportunities. If someone is not prepared for that, it’s most likely that person will fail. Lots of people decide to be self-employed and make their own company, make their decisions and do whatever they want. It is not a bad idea; it is a risky one that’s for sure. According to ‘Luminate Prospects’ 13% of creative arts graduates decide to open their own business or be self-employed/freelancers.[1]  This is their main activity, but most of them also have second jobs to keep them going. One of the examples of a very successful person who decided to make their own Theatre Company is Felix Barrett who created “Punchdrunk” not long after graduating from the university. He was 22 when he decided to take the risk and lots of people in the whole world are glad, he did. [6] Even with that huge risk of failure in the art industry, that sector grows every year.  </p>
            <p>“In 2019, there were over 2.1 million people employed in the creative industries sector, which was an increase of 3% from 2018. Since 2011, the number of jobs in the sector had increased by 34.5%, which is more than three times the growth rate of employment in the UK overall (11.4%). In the cultural sector, there were 676,000 people employed in 2019, representing an increase of 2.6% from 2018. Since 2011, the number of jobs in the sector had grown by 24%.” [2]</p>
            <p>It is fortunate for all the new students, to know there is a chance for them as well. Unfortunately, with the knowledge those young people have now, it may take them much longer to find a good position they can keep and be happy for a long time forward. </p>
            <p>  “Becoming a professional actor can be incredibly hard, actors have to deal with a lot of rejection. But that doesn't mean it's impossible. If an actor is hardworking, dedicated to learning and persistent enough; it is definitely possible to become a professional actor”. [4]</p>

                <p>There is no recent website to help young people gain more knowledge, and experience, and meet new people across the environment they are interested in. I’m talking about only artists, looking for artists. Students who are willing to work for free just to build their profiles, and portfolios. Many of them are lost, the day of graduation it’s just around the corner, and they are waking up realising they have nothing, nothing to show, nothing to be proud of. </p>
                <p>Doing my research, I did find Facebook pages where you can post information about yourself, you can also add some headshots and find people who are looking for actors and extras. Unfortunately, it is not confirmed by anything, you do not have any option to check if those projects or people are real and if it is safe. Many people are posting different things on Facebook and nowadays it is hard to find honest ones.[7] The other thing is, most of the people over there are looking for paying jobs and those are for more experienced people than students. Using the “AFTER-uni-LIFE” website, you can check if everything is legit or not. You can see what they were doing before, and with whom they were working before. You can check all you need to know. This website is for students, but most importantly it is free and without any hidden costs. There are also agencies, that you can join without experience, and they help you find a job. But it is mostly paid partnership. I do not know many students who joined any agency, and the reason is money.[3] There is always an option to research castings nearby by yourself, the problem with that is normally when there is a ‘’walk-in’’ audition you must wait in the queue for hours, everyone is tired and losing interest, the atmosphere is depressing and most likely they not going to choose you.[8] It is much easier if the people ‘in charge’ can look at you before, search if they like how you look, and how you act and then invite you because they are already interested. One more option will be, to try your luck with government help, but unfortunately, when searching for an “actor job” in “London” there is not even one actual actor job, only a -production help, -the head of casting or -tutors.

                <p>Results of the survey, about how students and graduates deal with life apart from university and if they would find it helpful to register to a website that will make finding job opportunities in an art environment easier. The survey contains 11 simple questions, most of them with one answer only, few had open questions where they could write their answers. I gathered people from my drama course but also, students from “Middlesex University” fashion designers’ course, and a few people who recently graduated. According to my survey only 40% polled, work in a field they studied or study at university. Which is a very small number, students don’t have any opportunities to find a job, gain more experience, and fill their CV enough to show it confidently to their next employer. 90% of those polled, said they did not receive any help from their university, to find a job after graduation. For the question, of whether they think the website would be helpful and if they would consider registering, almost 100% said yes. I asked open questions to make sure everyone can say what they think of the website and how they would improve it. One of the questions was “What would you like to find on such a website?” here are some of the answers I find most helpful. </p>
                <p>- I’d like to find the support, the guidance, the opportunities for everyone to participate in and gain some experience too</p>
                <p>- Job opportunities, making connections with industry professionals, advice on setting up businesses, opportunities to travel in the arts</p>
                <p>- Opportunity to find anything to do with acting. Big or small just a chance to put my foot in the door.</p>
                <p>Looking at those answers I can see how many students do not have, any idea how to find their ‘dream’ job. Just talking with my colleagues gave me a new view of young people trying to find themselves and find their future in bright colours. </p>
                <p>“What do you think would be most helpful for you personally?”</p>
                <p>- To be more informed and guided by universities on professions in the arts from year 1 (not just near graduation) as it would help establish work experience, connections and job opportunities in advance</p>
                <p>- Casting opportunities and any backstage roles or skills of options that has been taught to me during university like lighting operator opportunities etc.</p>
                <p>- Industry news and insights</p>

                <p>All those people that answered those questions were thinking very similarly about their life after graduation, it is very unsure, but they also agreed that the website would be very helpful to reach their goals. They would like to be more informed about the opportunities out there, and they would like to make something of it. Students in the art industry are aware of how hard it is to find a job after graduation, but most of them just don’t know how to make it easier. 
                    
                    <p> According to all the gathered information by researching, talking with students, making interviews
                 and looking at the results of the survey, I can clearly see how important is to make decisions about
                 your future as soon as possible. Right now, it is not quite possible, with the tools that are existing
                 many people will fail and that is not because they are worse than others, just less lucky, and less
                 prepared. With the proposed website we could change that. Students from all over could join and
                 make their life easier. Build their experience, connections and new better future. It is not only a
                 hypothesis, it is a fact that many agreed to. We should give young people a chance to find a safe place
                 where they could see the progress they are making. Meet people who are in a similar situation and
                 help each other out so that in the future not even one of them will feel like they failed, or they did
                 not have enough resources. Everyone starts from nothing, but with a little help, they can finish their
                 adventure with an amazing future in front of them.
